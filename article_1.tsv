The Martyred Presidents - Wikipedia	The Martyred Presidents is a 1901 American film directed by Edwin S. Porter.	The film, just over a minute long, is composed of two shots. In the first, a girl sits at the base of an altar or tomb, her face hidden from the camera. At the center of the altar, a viewing portal displays the portraits of three U.S. Presidents—Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, and William McKinley—each victims of assassination. In the second shot, which runs just over eight seconds long, an assassin kneels feet of Lady Justice.	The Martyred Presidents	Edwin S.
