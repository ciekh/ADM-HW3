Americana (film) - Wikipedia	Americana is a 1983 American drama film starring, produced, edited and directed by David Carradine. The screenplay and story, written by Richard Carr, was based on a portion of the 1947 novel, The Perfect Round, by Henry Morton Robinson. The novel's setting was originally post-World War II, but the screenplay involved the post-war experiences of a Vietnam War veteran, obsessed with restoring an abandoned carousel.[1][2] In 1981, the film won The People's Choice Award at the Director's Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival. Financing the film himself, Carradine shot most of the footage for the film, which was co-produced by Skip Sherwood, in 1973 with a band of 26 people, mostly his family and friends, over the course of 18 days. Problems with financing and distribution kept the film from being released until 1983. The film was well received by audiences, but met with primarily negative criticism.[2]	A down on his luck, former Green Beret captain, freshly discharged from the Vietnam War, drifts into Drury, Kansas. There he finds a derelict merry-go-round that he decides to restore.  The people of the town have mixed reactions: some support his efforts while others hinder them. Among his supporters are two local business men: a hardware store owner and Mike, a gas station proprietor.  Both men supply employment to the veteran as well as parts and tools for his endeavor. Another helpful character is a young local girl, who watches the reconstruction efforts from afar, and scampers off when she is seen. The girl provides a tool box and some food. Detractors of the veteran's efforts include a band of local teenagers.  The protagonist is also harassed by the town's sheriff. When the town's ruffians vandalize the half-restored carousel, the soldier redoubles his efforts. By this time he has found, to his displeasure, that Mike's favorite pastime is to officiate the weekly cock fights, and the two have a falling-out. Mike refuses to make good on a promise of a much needed part for the carousel, unless the soldier agrees to fight a dog. The soldier reluctantly agrees to the fight during which he kills the dog. After installing the last piece that completes the carousel's restoration, he lays the dog's body inside it, starts it up and walks away, while the townspeople look on.
